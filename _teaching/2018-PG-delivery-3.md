Since 2018, Andrew has been devlivered content for a number of level 7 (MSc) PGT modules. 

Advanced Bioinformatics
======
**Programme:** MSc Bioinformatics (core); MSc Medical Bioscience (optional)

**Date:** 2018 - Present

**Overview:** 'Advanced Bioinformatics' (BIS7018-B) is a semester 2 module, which aims to develop students with predominantly biology-based backgrounds (as opposed to 'computer science' backgrounds) into competent computational biologists. The module is workshop based, giving participants the opportunity to get 'hands-on' with real-world data and coding-problems. We focus on UNIX and python, although the mainlearning outcome we work towards is really the ability to 'critically think' or 'probelm solve'.
