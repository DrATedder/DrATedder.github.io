Since 2018, Andrew has been module leader for a number of level 7 (MSc) PGT modules. While specific details age given below, in each case Andrew was responsible for module development, content creation and delivery.

Advanced Bioinformatics
======
**Programme:** MSc Bioinformatics (core); MSc Medical Bioscience (optional)

**Date:** 2018 - Present

**Overview:** 'Advanced Bioinformatics' (BIS7018-B) is a semester 2 module, which aims to develop students with predominantly biology-based backgrounds (as opposed to 'computer science' backgrounds) into competent computational biologists. The module is workshop based, giving participants the opportunity to get 'hands-on' with real-world data and coding-problems. We focus on UNIX and python, although the mainlearning outcome we work towards is really the ability to 'critically think' or 'probelm solve'.

'Omics' Techniques in Biology and Healthcare
======
**Programme:** MSc Bioinformatics (core); MSc Medical Bioscience (optional)

**Date:** 2018 - Present

**Overview:** 'Omics' (BIS7019-B) is a semester 1 module aimed at introducing students from a wide variety of backgrounds to 'big data' and computational biology. Topics covered include a core of 'Genomics', 'Transcriptomics', 'Proteomics' and 'Metagenomics', but we feature a variety of areas more broadly depending on student interest. We are very 'problem-based' for this module, with sessions being primarily workshops supported by interactive tutorials. The key being to allow the students to get 'hands-on' with techniques, and then allowing critical-thinking and context to be applied when they know more.

Research Project Preparation and Plan
======
**Programme:** MSc Medical Bioscience (core); MSc Bioinformatics (core); MSc Physiology and Molecular Biology (core); MSc Skin Science and Stem Cell Biology (core)

**Date:** 2020 - Present

**Overview:** 'Research Proj. Prep. & Plan' (BIS7022-B) is a skills-based module positioned in semester 2 and aimed at ensuring students from our suite of level 7 (MSc) courses have suitable analytical skills going into their reseach projects (thesis). The module is workshop-based, and covers a variety of analytical and computational techniques that students will find useful when they have their data 'in hand'.
