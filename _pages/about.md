# Our Research

Ancient DNA offers a whole host of 'delightful' issues typically not encountered when working with modern DNA samples. When one attempts to apply modern metagenomic methods to aDNA samples, things get really 'interesting'. Here at the Computational Bio-Arch group at the University of Bradford, we are working to try to disentangle to methodological issues with the hope of getting to grips with some of the fundamental questions related to oral microbiome evolution.
